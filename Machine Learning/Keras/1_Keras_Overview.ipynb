    "Keras is the high-level API of the TensorFlow platform. It provides an approachable, highly-productive interface for solving machine learning (ML) problems, with a focus on modern deep learning. Keras covers every step of the machine learning workflow, from data processing to hyperparameter tuning to deployment. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation."

    "#### Layers\n",
    "The tf.keras.layers.Layer class is the fundamental abstraction in Keras. A Layer encapsulates a state (weights) and some computation (defined in the tf.keras.layers.Layer.call method).\n",
    "\n",
    "Weights created by layers can be trainable or non-trainable. Layers are recursively composable: If you assign a layer instance as an attribute of another layer, the outer layer will start tracking the weights created by the inner layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use layers to handle data preprocessing tasks like normalization and text vectorization. Preprocessing layers can be included directly into a model, either during or after training, which makes the model portable."

    "#### Models\n",
    "A model is an object that groups layers together and that can be trained on data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest type of model is the Sequential model, which is a linear stack of layers. For more complex architectures, you can either use the Keras functional API, which lets you build arbitrary graphs of layers, or use subclassing to write models from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tf.keras.Model class features built-in training and evaluation methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- tf.keras.Model.fit: Trains the model for a fixed number of epochs.\n",
    "- tf.keras.Model.predict: Generates output predictions for the input samples.\n",
    "- tf.keras.Model.evaluate: Returns the loss and metrics values for the model; configured via the tf.keras.Model.compile method.\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods give you access to the following built-in training features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Callbacks. You can leverage built-in callbacks for early stopping, model checkpointing, and TensorBoard monitoring. You can also implement custom callbacks.\n",
    "- Distributed training. You can easily scale up your training to multiple GPUs, TPUs, or devices.\n",
    "- Step fusing. With the steps_per_execution argument in tf.keras.Model.compile, you can process multiple batches in a single tf.function call, which greatly improves device utilization on TPUs."
